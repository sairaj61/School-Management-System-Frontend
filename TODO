ðŸš€ Production Readiness TODO List
ðŸ”¹ 1. Versioning & Rollback
 Tag Docker images with git commit SHA (e.g., school-frontend:<sha>)

 Store or log deployed image tag for rollback tracking

 Update GitHub Action to accept custom tags or rollback to previous

ðŸ”¹ 2. Health Check
 Add health check endpoint to the frontend (e.g., /health)

 Add a step in GitHub Actions (or entrypoint) to curl this endpoint after container start

 Fail deployment if health check fails

ðŸ”¹ 3. Blue-Green or Zero-Downtime Deployment
 Run new container on a temporary port (e.g., 8080)

 Validate health of new version

 Switch Nginx or reverse proxy to new container

 Gracefully remove old container

ðŸ”¹ 4. HTTPS and Security
 Install and configure Certbot (Letâ€™s Encrypt) for SSL on frontend EC2

 Update Nginx config to redirect HTTP â†’ HTTPS

 Add security headers in Nginx config (CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.)

ðŸ”¹ 5. Logging & Monitoring
 Forward Nginx and Docker logs to CloudWatch or a log system (like ELK)

 Set up monitoring (e.g., Uptime Kuma, Prometheus + Grafana)

 Configure alerts for failed health checks or crashes

ðŸ”¹ 6. Clean Environment Practices
 Run docker system prune -f periodically (with care)

 Add cron job or GitHub Action to clean old Docker image versions

 Use .env or secret managers for sensitive config (instead of raw env)

ðŸ”¹ 7. Infrastructure Improvements (Optional)
 Move Docker image hosting to Amazon ECR

 Replace SSH/scp with docker pull from ECR

 Use Terraform or Ansible for EC2 provisioning and deployment

ðŸ”¹ 8. Deployment Confirmation
 Post message to Slack/Email with:

Deployed version

EC2 instance

Health check status

ðŸ§¾ Example Final Goal
âœ” Auto-deploy on merge to main
âœ” Dockerized build with school-frontend:<tag>
âœ” HEALTHY backend integration via injected IP
âœ” HTTPS Nginx setup with Certbot
âœ” No downtime
âœ” Logs visible in CloudWatch
âœ” Auto-cleaned Docker environment
